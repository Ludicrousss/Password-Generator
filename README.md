Password Generator
This is a simple Python script that generates random passwords based on specified length and complexity.

How it Works
The script utilizes the random and string modules in Python to generate passwords. It offers three levels of complexity:

Low: Generates passwords using lowercase letters and digits.
Medium: Generates passwords using both lowercase and uppercase letters, along with digits.
High: Generates passwords using lowercase and uppercase letters, digits, and punctuation symbols.
Users can specify the length of the password and choose the complexity level through a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Tkinter.
